# Math

## Introduction

The discipline of [[math]] concerns the study of various mathematical fictions. Various objects are instantiated at will and life is breathed into them by particular agents, in this case humans.

Yes, this document takes the strong opinionated stance that mathematics and all germane literature is the work of the human mind. While some may find this perspective attenuated by the congruence between mathematical objects and the physical universe, this does not preclude man his fictional playthings.

### Philosophy

The philosophy that informs this wiki is a subspecies of fictionalism. The aforementioned concordance implies, for this author at least, both physical reality and the human mind being shaped by the same hand. I'll explore this vantage point in another article that concerns itself with the philosophy of mathematics.
