# Language Study

Repo for my language notes

## Intro

This is will be a repo to collect my language study notes for different languages. I plan to `attempt` to read books in various languages of the world and slowly translate words that I am unfamiliar with in order to gain knowledge.

## Does this method work for language acquisition?

Idk :). Usually I attempt to master the phonology of a language first. Sounding like a German native is a ton of fun. Then I move on to master grammar and then vocabulary. So if you see a language here, that means I already *mostly* mastered it's appreciable phonetic inventory.


## Languages

### (Spanish)[spanish/]

This is my native tongue. Nevertheless, my ability in this language has atrophied to some degree. Hence this practice.
